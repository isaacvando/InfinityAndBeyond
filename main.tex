% Outline

% intuitions about infinity
% - it is the biggest thing, and yet inf + 1 = inf?

% sets

% What it means to say two things are the same size in the finite case
% - counting to a natural number, equivalent to pairing up each item

% grouping items 

% math is about generalizing ideas. We can't count up to a natural number anymore but we can still pair items up with each other. Negative numbers are a generalizing.
% the naturals are in bijection with the regular polygons. So they have the same size. Also in bij with self

% BUT, counter to our intuition, subsets can be the same size. 
% Show example in the finite case where this is obviously not true
% Show that finite subsets of an infinite set are not the same size
% Show that the naturals are in bijection with the even numbers, and that it can go as far as we want, like the perfect squares, or further
% We can take this further to N x N. Or Even N x N x N, or even more! Or show Q

% BUT, it stops at a point. the naturals are not in bij with the binary sequences
% - cantor space is a whole new size of infinity, the same as the real numbers

% We can go further. Introduce powerset.
%  Maybe mention functions R -> R are \aleph_2
% no biggest infinity

% Continuum hypothesis

% This is only the beginning. There is infinty beyond this infinity chain! Mention large cardinals. 

% Close with HOW BIG infinity is. How amazing it is we can work with it. How mysterious it is. Maybe some follow up questinos that couldn't be touched on.
